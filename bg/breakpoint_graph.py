class BreakpointGraph(object):
    """ Class providing implementation of breakpoint graph data structure and most utilized operations on it.

    :class:`BreakpointGraph` anticipates to work with :class:`bg.vertex.BGVertex`, :class:`bg.edge.BGEdge` and :class:`bg.multicolor.Multicolor` classes instances, but is not limited to them. Extreme caution has to be assumed when working with non-expected classes.



    The engine of graph information storage, low-level algorithms implementation is powered by NetworkX package MultiGraph data structure. This class provides a smart wrapping around it to perform most useful, from combinatorial bioinformatics stand point, operations and manipulations.

    Class carries following attributes carrying information about graphs structure:

    *   :attr:`BreakpointGraph.bg`: instance of NetworkX MultiGraph class

    Main operations:

    *   :meth:`BreakpointGraph.add_bgedge`: adds an instance of :class:`bg.edge.BGEdge` to the current :class:`BreakpointGraph`
    *   :meth:`BreakpointGraph.add_edge`: adds a new :class:`bg.edge.BGEdge`, constructed from a pair of supplied vertices instances and :class:`bg.multicolor.Multicolor` object, to the current :class:`BreakpointGraph`
    *   :meth:`BreakpointGraph.get_vertex_by_name`: returns a :class:`bg.vertex.BGVertex` instance by provided ``name`` argument
    *   :meth:`BreakpointGraph.get_edge_by_two_vertices`: returns a first edge (order is determined by ``key`` NetworkX MultiGraph edge attribute) between two supplied :class:`bg.vertex.BGVertex`
    *   :meth:`BreakpointGraph.get_edges_by_vertex`: returns a generator yielding :class:`bg.edge.BGEdge`
    *   :meth:`BreakpointGraph.edges_between_two_vertices`: returns a generator yielding :class:`bg.edge.BGEdge`  between two supplied vertices
    *   :meth:`BreakpointGraph.connected_components_subgraphs`: returns a generator of :class:`BreakpointGraph` object, that represent connected components of a current :class:`BreakpointGraph` object, deep copying(by default) all information of current :class:`BreakpointGraph`
    *   :meth:`BreakpointGraph.delete_edge`: deletes and edge from perspective of multi-color substitution of supplied vertices
    *   :meth:`BreakpointGraph.delete_bgedge`: deletes a supplied :class:`bg.edge.BGEdge` instance from perspective of substituting multi-colors.
    *   :meth:`BreakpointGraph.split_edge`: deletes a supplied :class:`bg.multicolor.Multicolor` instance in identifies edge from two supplied vertices.
    *   :meth:`BreakpointGraph.split_bgedge`: splits a :class:`bg.edge.BGEdge` with respect to provided guidance
    *   :meth:`BreakpointGraph.split_all_edges_between_two_vertices`: splits all edges between two supplied vertives with respect to provided guidance.
    *   :meth:`BreakpointGraph.split_all_edges`: splits all edge in :class:`BreakpointGraph` with respect to provided guidance.
    *   :meth:`BreakpointGraph.delete_all_edges_between_two_vertices`: deletes all edges between two given vertices, by plain deleting them from MultiGraph underling structure.
    *   :meth:`BreakpointGraph.merge_all_edges_between_two_vertices`: merges all edge between two given vertices creating a single edge containing information about multi-colors in respective edges.
    *   :meth:`BreakpointGraph.merge_all_edges`: merges all edges in current :class:`BreakpointGraph`.
    *   :meth:`BreakpointGraph.merge`: merges two :class:`BreakpointGraph` instances with respect to vertices, edges, and multicolors.
    *   :meth:`BreakpointGraph.update`: updates information in current :class:`BreakpointGraph` instance by adding new :class:`bg.edge.BGEdge` instances form supplied :class:`BreakpointGraph`.
